# Twitter Sentiment Analysis Model 🐦📊

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to analyze the sentiment of tweets as either **positive** or **negative**. Leveraging a robust dataset and fundamental NLP techniques, the model delivers strong predictive performance on unseen tweet data.

## Dataset 📁
- Source: Kaggle's Twitter Sentiment Analysis dataset
- Size: ~1.6 million tweets
- Features: Pre-labeled tweets with sentiment annotations
- Preprocessing: No missing values detected in the dataset

## Methodology ⚙️
- Data split: 80% training, 20% testing (`test_size=0.2`)
- Text cleaning: Tokenization + Stemming
- Model training: Machine learning approach (model details can be expanded here)
- Evaluation: Accuracy of **77.66%** on the test set

## Highlights ✨
- Efficient preprocessing with no missing data
- NLP techniques applied to extract sentiment-relevant features
- Solid baseline accuracy—room for future improvements with advanced models or feature tuning

## Next Steps 🚀
- Implement stopword removal and lemmatization for cleaner input
- Experiment with deep learning architectures (e.g. LSTM, BERT)
- Add dashboard for visual sentiment distribution (maybe a Tableau embed?)
